# Data Preparation Processes for Social Buzz: Social Media Content Analytics

To ensure the raw data was clean, organized, and ready for analysis, I used Microsoft Excel and followed a systematic data preparation process with three main steps:

1. [Data Exploration](#data-exploration)
2. [Data Cleaning](#data-cleaning)
3. [Data Modelling](#data-modelling)


## Data Exploration

For this project, I received 7 datasets from Social Buzz: User, Profile, Location, Session, Content, Reaction, and Reaction Types. However, only 3 datasets were relevant to the business questions and were used for analysis: *Reaction*, *Content*, and *Reaction Types*.

### Dataset Details:
#### 1. Content:
- Content ID: Unique identifier for uploaded content.
- User ID: Unique identifier for users (exists in the User table).
- Content Type: Type of uploaded content. 
- Category: Category associated with the content.
- URL: Link to the content's storage location.

#### 2. Reaction: 
- Content ID: Unique identifier for uploaded content.
- User ID: Unique identifier for users (exists in the User table).
- Reaction Type: Type of user reaction.
- Datetime: Date and time of the reaction.

#### 3. Reaction Types: 
- Reaction Type: Type of user reaction.
- Sentiment: Classification of reaction as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Score: Popularity score calculated by Social Buzz.


## Data Cleaning:

To ensure the data was accurate, consistent, and reliable, I performed the following steps:

1. **Convert CSV to XLSX:** Converted raw CSV files into Excel format for easier handling.
   
2. **Text-to-Columns Conversion:** Used Excel‚Äôs "Text-to-Columns" feature to separate data fields as needed.
   
3. **Identify Missing Values:** Detected missing data using "Find & Select" ‚Üí "Go To Special" ‚Üí "Blanks."
   
4. **Delete Blank Rows:** Removed 980 rows with blanks in the *Reaction* dataset; no blank cells were found in the other datasets.
   
5. **Remove Unnecessary Columns:** Deleted irrelevant columns, including UserID from *Reaction* and *Content* datasets, and URL from the *Content* dataset.
    
6. **Data Type Adjustments:** Ensured all columns had appropriate data types for analysis.
    
7. **Text Formatting:** After merging the tables in the Data Modelling process, pplied the Excel formula ```=PROPER(text)``` to standardize text formatting for consistency and readability.


## Data Modelling

To structure and align the data for analysis, I prepared and merged the datasets through the following steps:

#### 1. Merging Datasets:

- Used Power Query to combine the three datasets: *Content*, *Reaction*, and *Reaction Types*.

#### 2. Key Relationships:

- The *Content* table links to the *Reaction* table via the Content ID field.
- The *Reaction Types* table links to the *Reaction* table via the Reaction Type field.

This setup creates a central *Reaction* table, with the *Content* and *Reaction Types* tables connected through their respective fields. This relational structure ensures seamless data alignment for analysis and reporting.

These processes will produce the final datasets that will be imported into Tableau to uncover insights.
